Implement, from scratch, without any library, a web page. Using all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

## Installation
This webpage rendition is only available by hosting it on your local server. Therefore, you must clone the repo from github and run any of the index.html files on a live server.

## Other Comments
